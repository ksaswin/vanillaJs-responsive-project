## Shuffle and Sort

### Description

Tried developing something using the vanilla JS for the first time!

The app simply sorts and shuffles an array of numbers from `1 - 9`. Followed a responsive design (assuming the screen width for mobiles to be `375px`).

### Deployment

Deployed the app on Github pages: [Shuffle N Sort](https://ksaswin.github.io/vanillaJs-responsive-project/)

### Running Locally

Clone the repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ksaswin/vanillaJs-responsive-project.git
```

Move into the directory:

```shell
cd vanillaJs-responsive-project
```

You can use the app either by opening the `index.html` file on your browser or by setting up a `live-server` (for hot reloads).

The live server:

```shell
npm install -g live-server
live-server
```
